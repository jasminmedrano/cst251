          <td>I feel like these sketches were much more rushed than my first ones. I think they look alot similar to my other sketches I did in the beginning.</td>

              <td>I know that my sketches may look messy and not as detialed as my first ones but I know that my teammates and I have already decided on how it is going to look like. Plus we are going to use my lab 6 for a reference.</td>
