			<h1>Lab 13:Typography 1</h1>
			<p>This lab helps us explore more about the importance on typography and allowed us to replicate a website from scratch.</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>

			<p>I definitely experienced so many challenges with this lab. Especially because I didn't know where to start. I ended up downloading finder font and I reached out to a classmate. Which then they were able to give me a link to a color hex picker website. That save me alot of time. Overall, I took seven hours on this lab.</p>
			<h3>Problems</h3>

			<p>I had so many problems with this lab. Both my partner and I kept having the same problems. I kept wanting to give up and quit many times. I had extra help with my older sister while doing this lab. I believe the biggest problem I had was trying to do the round border on "sign up." That drove me crazy because it wasn't a circle, oval, or a rectangle. I will never be able to look at a round oval cirle border the same. It took me an hour to figure what it was. Here are the rest of the problems I had:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Finding the correct font (I had to find a similar one because it didn't get the original)</li>
					<li>Making the "Hello." bigger without it being too centered down having alot of space between from the nav bar</li>
					<li>How to get rid of the inside hover square that showed up in "sign up."</li>
					<li>Finding the little blue blob cloud replica on the nav bar. (I honestly like my cloud better. It is cuter!)</li>
					<li>The position of the paragraph</li>
					<li>I honestly forgot the rest of the problems.</li></ul>

			<h4>Results</h4>
			<p>I will say that it looks pretty close to the original. I absolutely hated this lab. I think I lost like all my hair from the stress of trying to exactly like it. I will never complain about a website structure ever again. I think I got PTSD from doing this lab.</p>
