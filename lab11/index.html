		<h1>Lab 11:Advance Block-level Styling 1</h1>
		<p>The purpose of this lab was to further customize our files with block levels like sidebar divs and sticks divs.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>There wasn't any major problems/challenges since my partner was able to explain to me how he did his lab. From there I was able to understand which divs and tags I would use for mine. I also knew how the outcome would be.</p> 
		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>There was no big problems besides my placement of my tags and having to go back and forth to check if it showed up correctly.</p>
		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>I was delighted with the result since we were able to learn something new and it looks alot nicer than my old index.html.</p>
