		<h1 style="color: purple; font-size: 40px">Lab 9:Styling Block Elements</h1>
		<p>This lab is to add more elements towards our CSS file and explore the different elements/selectors there is.</p>
		<h2 style="color: purple; font-size: 40px">Challenges</h2>
		<p>The only challenge I had was figuring out how to change my div tag color and size. I decided to go back to our class resources and learn through "Free Code Camp". From there I was able to use it as a reference and change it slightly to my desire look.</p>
		<h3 style="color: purple; font-size: 40px">Problems</h3>
		<p>No there was no major problems that I had to solve or figure out on my own.</p>
		<h4 style="color: purple; font-size: 40px">Results</h4>
		<p>I really liked messing around with the new styling blocks and the past selectors. It makes everything more organize and fun.</p>
