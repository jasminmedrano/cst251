	h1>Lab 5</h1>

			<p>The concept of this lab was to create a new index.html for lab 5 folder and add links/images to our html.</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>

			<p>I believe one minor challenge for me for this lab was getting the link to show up properly on my website. Also, checking that I was spelling correctly and closing my tags as I noticed that I forget to do so in past labs which is why most of my text looked wonky. I was able to go back and fix my past mistakes and learn from them.</p>
			<h3>Results</h3>

			<p>This lab was pretty fun I enjoyed seeing my images come up clearly and my links to my favorite websites. It is one of the labs that definitely made me smile during the process of it.</p>

			<h4>Websites</h4>
			<p>These are some of the websites I visit on the daily to either roam around or communicate with others. Although around this time I am almost never on my phone I hope you enjoy some of the websites I linked.</p>
			<p>This link heads to my personal instagram account where I like to communicate with others and post silly content about myself.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://instagram.com/j_m_e_otaku/">instagram.com</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This second link heads to a website I love to watch all my favorite animes and old cartoons in. Although it may not be cheap to pay for each month it is definitely worth it since it has many channels to watch from.</p>
