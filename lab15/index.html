			<h1>Lab 15: Fancy CSS 1</h1>
			<p id="rcorners1">This lab will help to understand the special effects and filters that can be put in a website. Like adding a shadow behind text or adding a filter.</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p id="rcorners2">I had some troubles with the gradient background. For some reason it didn't want to show up even though I had a div tag on my index. After some tries of trying a bit of everything I am not sure how I got it to work.</p>

			<h3>Problems</h3>
			<p id="rcorners3">One of the minor problems I had was getting a box shadow behind my photos. As soon as I put the shadow box it would automatically stack my images ontop of eachother. I didn't feel like spending more time on this lab. I ended up deciding to leave it like that.</p>

			<h4>Results</h4>
			<p id="rcorners4">I really loved seeing the new features especially the gradient. It gives a nice feeling to the whole thing. Makes it feel more lively.</p>
