		<h1>Lab 14: Typography 2</h1>
		<p>The purpose of this lab was to pick a more complicated website and try to replicate it without going to the main source.</p>
		
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>I had some challenges with the spacing. I kept going back and forth to organize the structure of my bottom tags.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>There was only two problems I couldn't solve for this lab. Were that I couldn't make the paragraph stretch out properly without messing up my code structure. The "I'm" is supposed to be inside the N and the "r" on director is supposed be inside of the "d". I also couldn't get rid of the extra space on the bottom of everything.</p>

		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>I didn't like these past 2 labs. However, I am glad that it didn't take me longer than the last one. In reality, it took me half the time. I wish that I can learn what I could have done differently to make the bottom spacing go away. Along with the paragraph to be stretched out properly.</p>
