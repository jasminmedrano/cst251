			<h1>Lab 6:More Complicated HTML</h1>
			<p>The purpose of this lab was to create a more complex index.html for our lab 6 and understand how/where to place the div tag. We also had to add a form to our lab 6 page on a seperate section and link our CSS file on our index.html.</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>I had some trouble with how to arrange and do the tags. I also had trouble figuring out Cyberduck since we never really went over it on class.</p>
			<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>I ended up getting help from my older sister by sharing one screen and her explaining what each tag should look like. As for the Cyberduck both my partner, sister, and I didn't know what to do for that section.</p>
