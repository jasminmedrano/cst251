	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
			<p>The concept of the lab was to create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>I had some trouble figuring out how to make the images work on the html.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>With some help of my older sister who took coding in CSUMB I was able to create the file structure.</p>
