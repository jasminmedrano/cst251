			 	<p>The purpose of this lab was to learn more about styling blocks and seeing how centering some items in our files create a organized look.</p>
			 </div>
			<div id="header2"><h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>Some of my challenges were understanding how to float or where to float certian things without ruining my structure in my code.</p> 
			</div>
			<div id="header3"><h3>Problems</h3>
			<p>Some of the bigger problems I had was making everything fall into place. Especially, with the float divs to go to the right or left. It made everything look wonky. After some experimenting I got it to look some what decent.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="header4"><h4>Results</h4>
			<p>I guess people weren't lying that float divs are a pain in the ass. They look so great in other websites but as soon as you try it. It makes you want to cry in the corner of your room. I did enjoy learning more about styling blocks elements.</p>
