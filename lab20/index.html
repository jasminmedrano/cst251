    			<td>The only problems I had were creating these "fast". Since I tend to stick and focus on the detials of things. Even though these are somewhat detialed I tried my best to go as quick as possible. The green colored are supposed to represent clickable buttons or may open a new tab.</td>
    			
    			<td>To be honest I am not that secure with my sketches I hope my teammates come up with better ideas. I feel like mine look too simple or too squished.</td>

    					<td>Another problem I had was creating better/different sketches after the fifth one. I tried to look at different dating website to have an idea of a good layout for our prison dating website. </td>

    					<td>I am not that great with organizing things to make a layout look good. I would do something like that picture down below.</td>
